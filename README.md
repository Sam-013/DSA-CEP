Project Title: **Sentiment Analysis with LSTM and Keras**

Project Description: Sentiment analysis using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with the user-friendly Keras library in Python. It involves deciphering whether a piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Its applications span a wide spectrum, from monitoring social media reactions to analyzing customer feedback and product reviews. For this walkthrough, we’ll focus on categorizing tweets into ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ sentiments.
